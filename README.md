# capstone-project-hacktiv8 : Student Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview

### Student Mental Health
This project focuses on analyzing **student mental health** conditions based on survey data. 
It explores factors like age, gender, stress levels, lifestyle habits, and academic pressure.

### Why This Project Matters
Mental health issues among students are increasingly common but often overlooked. Academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and lack of mental health 
awareness can silently affect students' well-being, performance, and overall life quality. Despite growing awareness, many students still don't seek help or access 
available support services. This project aims to highlight these patterns through data â€” so institutions can respond with better, more targeted support.

### Project Goals
- To explore and understand key factors influencing student mental health, such as stress levels, academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and access to support services.
- To identify patterns and relationships within the data using visualization techniques.
- To generate structured insights and actionable recommendations using IBM Granite AI.
- To help universities, mental health staff, and student communities make more informed decisions in supporting student well-being.

### Methodology
This project uses an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to examine student mental health survey data. Several visualization techniques are used to highlight patterns related to stress, lifestyle, and academic pressure.
To support deeper understanding, AI (IBM Granite) is used to generate structured insights and recommendations based on the analysis results.

### Tools Used
- **Python** For data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy** Data processing and manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** Data visualization
- **IBM Granite (via LangChain + Replicate)** To generate AI-driven insights, conlusion, and recommendations
- **Google Colab** As the development environment
